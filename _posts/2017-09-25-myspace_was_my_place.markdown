I'll always credit the beginning of my coding journey to MySpace. It truly was where I learned to code simple HTML/CSS. Creating custom profiles for my friends and I consumed my daily life, as well as lots and lots of blue eyeliner (yikes). I'd always been fascinated by computers and the web. Connect to a stranger in a different place to escape my small town, you bet! 

However, my real journey began in 2015 when I really didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I had made a website for my parent's small business and all my old (myspace) feelings came rushing back but this time I wanted to dive deeper. I enrolled in a small online class that really helped me get started with the command line, git, javascript and ruby. Of course, life got in the way, I got distracted and never pursued a career with my new found knowledge because I didn't feel like I had a support system or all the skills I would need to suceed.

Jump to now. I'm working a job that doesn't satisfy my need to create or challenge me in any way. Recently, I've read so many inspiring stories about how the tech industry has helped change the world and I want to get involved. I want to become a software engineer so I can make things, collaborate with like-minded people, constantly be learning, and work in a field that is always evolving.
