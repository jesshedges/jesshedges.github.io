The one thing I truly enjoy about HTML5 is that they let go of DIV tags. When I first learned HTML that was my biggest struggle. Now we are able to use tags that fit the structual names for each section of the webpage we are building (i.e. acticle, nav, section) . One of my favorite updates is the use of the video tag. It lets us install video easily onto our webpages without using flash. Luckily for me, I hardly ever used HTML so coming in to a new environment with HTML5 right off the bat was easy. I didn't have to relearn anything, which seems to be the main complaint when reading reviews.
