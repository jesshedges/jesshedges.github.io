<p>Hello, my name is Jess. I'm LIVING in Washington State and am stereotypically obsessed with Starbucks and the rain. I love cliches and long walks on the beach. My daughter's name is Kaiya and she's cooler than you. My chihuahua's name is Margaux and she's already barking at you. My car's name is Hannah because she's a basic white girl. I live to be socially and culturally conscious. I'm half native and half white. </p>
